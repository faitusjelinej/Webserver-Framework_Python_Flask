Question:
--------

Implement a web service (in Go, Python, or Java). Feel free to use a framework, if desired.
/min - given list of numbers and a quantifier (how many) provides min number(s)
/max - given list of numbers and a quantifier (how many) provides max number(s)
/avg - given list of numbers calculates their average
/median - given list of numbers calculates their median
/percentile - given list of numbers and quantifier 'q', compute the qth percentile of the list elements
No need to be concerned with resources, we're assuming there's plenty enough of memory, etc. The percentile should just return one
number. Use the nearest-rank method.


Approach:
---------
I used Flask library to create the webserver Framework

Program file: Problem2_Math.py
